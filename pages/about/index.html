        <h1>About Ayrton</h1>
        <p>I am a systems guy. I enjoy well written and simple code, which is why rust is my favorite language. I dabble in electrical and have a passion for open source.</p>
        
        <p>Currently I work at the University of Alberta as a graduate student and teaching assistant. I serve on the executive of the University of Alberta Computing Systems Society and work with non-profit businesses to transition away from the Microsoft/AWS/Google hegemony.</p>
